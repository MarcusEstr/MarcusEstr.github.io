### Lesson 16: Writing READMEs

#### Documentation

Documentation should be used on any project that you are working on. In the future, it may be an important document for company, other programmers, and yourself. 

A common form of documentation is the README.txt file included in the directory of a program - or included with a GitHub repository.

#### README

A readme should provide enough contnet to get a user up and running with the code. Include these sorts of elements - whatever is essential for the user:

- Description
- Installation
- Usage
- Known bugs

#### Markdown Syntax

**Bold**: ```My **bold** text.```

**Italic**: ```My _italic_ text```

**Inline code:** Use the ```  `backtick`  ``` symbol around the text.

**Titles:** `# H1, ## H2, ### H3, #### H4, ##### H5, ###### H6`

It is also possible to use HTML in Markdown, but is often unnecessary. 

Save a Markdown file as **.md** .
